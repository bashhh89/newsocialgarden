# PDF Generation Buttons Overview

## Current Implementation Status

Currently, the Scorecard Results page provides two options for downloading the report as a PDF:

### 1. "Download PDF Report" Button (Original Implementation)
- ✅ **Status:** Functional but not ideal
- **Technical approach:** Uses HTML/CSS rendering to generate PDFs
- **Issues:** 
  - The generated PDFs lack the visual polish of our designed mockups
  - Font rendering is inconsistent across different browsers/systems
  - Layout issues occur, especially with more complex content sections
  - Content may wrap or overflow unexpectedly

### 2. "PDF V2" Button (Under Development)
- ❌ **Status:** Currently not working (404 error)
- **Technical approach:** Uses pdfmake library for server-side PDF generation
- **Benefits when completed:**
  - Precise control over styling and layout
  - Consistent font rendering with embedded fonts (Plus Jakarta Sans)
  - Better handling of page breaks and section organization
  - Professional card-based layout with proper margins and spacing
  - Proper handling of markdown content
  - More visually appealing branding elements

## Development Challenge

The core issue with the "PDF V2" implementation is that the API endpoint (`/api/generate-scorecard-report`) is returning a 404 error when accessed. Our testing so far indicates that:

1. The simple test endpoint (`/api/pdf-test`) also returns a 404 error
2. The Next.js server recognizes and compiles the API routes (as shown in server logs)
3. The API routes themselves are correctly formatted according to Next.js conventions
4. The PDF generation logic itself works correctly when tested as a standalone Node.js script

## Next Steps

- Determine why API routes are not being properly recognized/accessed at runtime
- Consider alternative approaches if the issue persists:
  - Implement the PDF generation logic in a regular page route
  - Use a different approach for API routes
  - Investigate if there's a Next.js configuration issue affecting API route registration
  
Once the technical issues are resolved, the "PDF V2" implementation will provide a significantly better downloading experience with professionally-designed PDF outputs.
