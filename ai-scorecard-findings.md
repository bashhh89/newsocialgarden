# AI Efficiency Scorecard - Findings Summary

This document summarizes the findings from the analysis of the AI Efficiency Scorecard codebase, based on the questions and investigations conducted.

# 1. Analysis of "mock", "dummy", and "placeholder" References

An initial search was conducted across the codebase for the terms "mock", "dummy", and "placeholder".

**Key Findings:**

*   **Application Code (components and app directories):** References were found primarily for:
    *   Providing hints in UI input fields (`placeholder` attribute).
    *   Displaying default images when specific ones are unavailable (`placeholderImage`, `placeholder image path`).
    *   Indicating areas where dynamic content will be loaded (`InteractivePlaceholder.tsx`).
    *   Temporary or development-specific values (e.g., `link-placeholder`, `mockUser` in `app/learning-hub/social-media-snippets/page.tsx`).
    *   Remnants in backup files (`.bak` files).

*   **External Libraries (node_modules):** Numerous instances were found within libraries like `undici`, `yargs-parser`, `y18n`, `xmldoc`, and `unicode-trie`. These are internal to the libraries and are used for purposes such as mocking network requests for testing, argument parsing, internationalization, and internal data structures.

**Conclusion:** The references within the application code are generally related to UI/UX hints, fallback content, or development/testing data. The references in `node_modules` are part of external library implementations and should not be modified.

The process of generating the AI Efficiency Scorecard report involves several steps, from user interaction to the final PDF.

**Process Flow:**

1.  **User Interaction & History:** User answers assessment questions. Answers and questions are stored in a `history` array.
2.  **Generate Next Question:** Frontend calls `/api/scorecard-ai` with `history`, phase, and industry. Backend uses `AIProviderManager` (`lib/ai-providers.ts`) to call an AI (prioritizing Google Gemini, fallback to OpenAI) via `generateNextQuestion`. AI generates the next question (JSON). Backend validates and returns the question to the frontend.
3.  **Assessment Completion:** Steps 1 & 2 repeat until max questions (20) or phases are complete.
4.  **Initiate Report Generation:** Frontend calls `/api/scorecard-ai` with the complete `history`, industry, username, and `action: 'generateReport'`.
5.  **Calculate User Tier:** Backend (`/api/scorecard-ai`) calculates user tier (Dabbler, Enabler, Leader) based on `history` using weighted scoring and keyword analysis.

Based on the `systemPrompt` in `app/api/scorecard-ai/route.ts`, the AI is instructed to generate the Markdown report with the following mandatory sections:

1.  `## Overall Tier:`
2.  `## Key Findings` (containing subsections like **Strengths:** and **Weaknesses:**)
3.  `## Strategic Action Plan`
4.  `## Getting Started & Resources` (or `## Resources`)
5.  `## Illustrative Benchmarks`
6.  `## Your Personalized AI Learning Path` (or `## Learning Path`)

The report **must end** with the Learning Path section and contain no additional content, ads, or external links after it.

Analysis of `app/scorecard-preview-v6/page.tsx` revealed its purpose and limitations.

**Findings:**
*   The page fetches report HTML from `/api/generate-scorecard-report-v6` and displays it in an iframe.
*   It provides multiple buttons for triggering PDF downloads via different endpoints.
*   **Major Limitation:** It uses hardcoded `sampleScoreCardData` from `./preview-data.ts` for both HTML generation and PDF downloads.

**Conclusion:** This page functions effectively as a **developer preview tool** to visualize the report layout and test PDF generation with static data. However, it is **not production-ready** as a user-facing results page because it does not use dynamic data from a completed assessment.

*   **`ScoreCardData` Requirement:** Both `generateScorecardHTML` (`scorecard-html-generator.ts`) and the primary WeasyPrint endpoint (`app/api/generate-weasyprint-report/route.ts`) require a complete `ScoreCardData` object as input.

*   **AI Response Insufficient:** The response from `/api/scorecard-ai` (`generateReport` action) only provides `reportMarkdown` and `userAITier`, not the full `ScoreCardData` structure.

*   **Data Reconstruction Needed:** A critical step is required to construct the `ScoreCardData` object by combining the original assessment data (`UserInformation`, `QuestionAnswerHistory`) with the AI's output (`reportMarkdown`, `userAITier`). This logic must be implemented on the frontend results page or an intermediate backend step.

*   **External WeasyPrint Service:** PDF generation relies on an external service at `http://168.231.86.114:5001`. Its reliability and accessibility in production are external dependencies.

*   **PDF Styling Injection:** The WeasyPrint endpoint injects specific CSS for PDF rendering, which modifies the HTML generated by `scorecard-html-generator.ts`.

*   **Markdown Parsing Robustness:** The accuracy of the final HTML/PDF depends on the `parseMarkdown` function correctly handling the AI's Markdown output.
