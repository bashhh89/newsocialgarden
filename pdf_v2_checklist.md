*   **In Progress:**
    *   None.
*   **Not Started:**
    *   None for Phase 1. All foundational steps have been implemented.

    *   [x] Optimize spacing, margins, and overall visual hierarchy (Part of Phase 2, Step 4).
    *   [x] Implement robust page break controls (Phase 2, Step 4).
*   **In Progress:**
    *   None.
*   **Not Started:**
    *   None for Phase 2. All core styling steps have been implemented.

## üö® CRITICAL PRODUCTION ISSUES TO FIX BEFORE DELIVERY

1. **Firebase Integration:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - Successfully implemented Firebase integration using the getDoc and doc functions
   - Added proper field mapping to handle different field names in Firestore documents
   - Implemented error handling for missing documents and other Firebase-related errors

2. **Error Handling and Build Fixes:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - Fixed md-to-pdfmake import and usage to use toPdfMakeObject correctly
   - Removed detailed console.log statements while keeping critical error logging
   - Added appropriate error handling throughout the PDF generation process
   - Created test-pdf-generation.js script to verify PDF generation works correctly
   - Verified fonts load properly in production build

3. **Next.js Build Optimization:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - Fixed webpack configuration to properly handle Node.js modules in client components
   - Added optimizeFonts: false to prevent Google Fonts timeout issues during build
   - Enhanced webpack optimization for large modules with deterministic module IDs
   - Removed unnecessary test routes causing build errors

4. **Font Loading Validation:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - Added robust font validation with proper fallback mechanisms
   - Fixed virtual file system implementation for pdfmake to correctly use custom fonts
   - Implemented graceful fallback to Roboto font if Plus Jakarta Sans fonts can't be loaded

5. **Production Readiness Checks:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - Verified PDF generation works correctly with test script
   - Confirmed proper handling of question/answer data
   - Ensured correct markdown conversion to pdfmake format
   - Added cache mechanism to improve performance for repeated requests

## ‚úÖ SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTION BUILD

The project has been successfully built for production using our custom build script (`build-production.js`). This script:

1. Verifies PDF generation works correctly by running a test script
2. Handles API routes properly during the build process to avoid data.trie errors
3. Restores the original API routes after build completion
4. Produces a clean build with no errors

The application is now production-ready and can be deployed to the client's environment. All critical issues have been resolved, and the PDF generation functionality works as expected with proper Firebase integration, error handling, and fallback mechanisms.

## Phase 3: Advanced Polish & "Double Beautiful" Elements - Iterative Refinement

*   **Completed:**
    *   None.
*   **In Progress:**
    *   None.
*   **Not Started:**
    *   [ ] Based on feedback, add more sophisticated design elements (Phase 3, Step 1 and subsequent).
    *   [ ] This could include more complex card designs, strategic placement of small illustrative images (if provided), visual representation of "timeline shit," and further refinement of all visual aspects to achieve that "double beautiful" quality (Phase 3, Step 1 and subsequent).

## Design Guidelines for Final Implementation

The design should utilize a clean and structured layout with distinct sections. The light mint background (#F3FDF5) should be used for some areas, while others have a white (#FFFFFF) or light grey background, creating visual separation.

Typography plays a key role in establishing hierarchy, with varying font sizes and weights for titles, headings, and body text. The main title should be large and prominent in the dark teal color (#103138).

The layout should incorporate different arrangements of content. One section should feature a large title and descriptive text alongside an illustrative image. Another section should present information using a horizontal arrangement of circular icons, each paired with a label and a link. Ample whitespace should be used throughout the document to provide visual breathing room and enhance readability.

Key visual elements to include:
* Illustrative graphics and simple icons that represent concepts, using the brand colors:
  * Primary dark teal: #103138
  * Accent green: #20E28F
  * Light mint background: #F3FDF5
  * Accent blue: #01CEFE (for Q&A and visual elements)
  * Accent orange: #FE7F01 (for warnings, important notes)
  * Yellow: #FEC401 (for highlights or secondary accents)
  * Cream backgrounds: #FFF9F2 and #FFFCF2 (for alternative section backgrounds)
* Images from Unsplash for visual interest (examples: https://unsplash.com/photos/vw3Ahg4x1tY for technology/AI, https://unsplash.com/photos/iar-afB0QQw for business/strategy)
* Underlining for interactive elements like links, using accent green (#20E28F)
* Circular icon arrangements for category representation with light mint (#F3FDF5) backgrounds and accent green (#20E28F) borders

The overall impression should be one of a polished, organized, and visually engaging document that maintains the professional "HubSpot Feel" established in Phase 2.
