## Issues Fixed

   - Problem: Reports were missing key sections like benchmarks, resources, and learning path
   - Solution: Enhanced the `cleanReportMarkdown` function to verify all required sections are present
   - Added detailed section validation and logging to identify missing sections

2. **Missing Company Name**
   - Problem: Company name was not being displayed in the final report
   - Solution: Added extraction of company name from assessment history
   - Enhanced templates to properly display company name in multiple places

3. **Missing Final Score**
   - Problem: The numeric score was not included in the report
   - Solution: Added score extraction from markdown and included it in the API response
   - Enhanced HTML generation to prominently display the score

4. **Insufficient Benchmark Content**
   - Problem: Benchmarks section was incomplete or missing tier comparisons 
   - Solution: Added detection for missing benchmark tier sections
   - Improved extraction of benchmark content from AI-generated markdown

5. **Incomplete "Getting Started & Resources" Section**
   - Problem: Required subsections like meeting agenda and example prompts were missing
   - Solution: Added validation and fallback content for the resources section
   - Enhanced section extraction with better regex patterns

6. **Incomplete "Learning Path" Section** 
   - Problem: Learning path section was missing or incomplete
   - Solution: Added multiple regex patterns to capture various heading formats
   - Added fallback content when the section is missing

## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced Markdown Cleaning and Validation

Modified the `cleanReportMarkdown` function in `app/api/scorecard-ai/route.ts` to:
- Be more careful with horizontal rule removal to avoid cutting off content
- Add specific validation for required sections
- Check for missing tier sections in the benchmarks
- Validate resources section for required subsections
- Add detailed logging for troubleshooting

### 2. Improved Section Extraction

Enhanced the `extractSections` function in `app/api/generate-scorecard-report-v6/scorecard-html-generator.ts` to:
- Use more robust regex patterns to find section content
- Try multiple alternative patterns for each section
- Generate fallback content if sections are missing or incomplete
- Add more detailed logging

### 3. Better Company Name and Score Handling

Modified the report generation process to:
- Extract company name from user responses in assessment history
- Include company name in the generated PDF header and report content
- Extract and properly format the final score
- Include both in API responses

### 4. Updated Template Replacement

Enhanced the `replacePlaceholders` function to:
- Properly handle null or missing values
- Use default values when data is missing
- Apply special handling for score display
- Fix HTML escaping issues

### 5. Better Preview Page

Updated the scorecard preview page (`app/scorecard-preview-v6/page.tsx`) to:
- Support loading real report data by ID
- Construct proper ScoreCardData objects from AI-generated content
- Toggle between sample data and real report data
- Show detailed information about the report data being displayed

## Testing and Verification

These changes have been tested with both sample data and real AI-generated reports. The improvements ensure that:

1. All required sections now appear in the report
2. Company name is properly displayed 
3. Final score is shown with the overall tier
4. Benchmark sections include all required tiers
5. Resources section includes all required subsections
6. Learning path section is properly formatted and displayed

The preview page now serves as both a development tool and a way to verify real reports, making it easier to identify and fix any remaining issues. 

## Deployment Notes
