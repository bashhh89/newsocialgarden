# Property/Real Estate B2B Question Fix - Summary Report

## Issue Identified & Fixed
We identified that some questions for the "Property/Real Estate" industry in the AI Efficiency Scorecard were focused on personal property ownership/investment rather than B2B contexts. For example, questions mentioned "your real estate portfolio" instead of focusing on the user's business operations in their real estate company or agency.

## Solution Implemented
We modified the system prompt that generates industry-specific questions to ensure all Property/Real Estate questions are properly B2B-focused. The prompt now:

1. Explicitly instructs the AI to create B2B-focused questions addressing business operations
2. Prohibits consumer-focused questions that reference personal property portfolios
3. Directs questions toward key business areas:
   - Property management operations
   - Agent productivity and training
   - Marketing and lead generation for the agency
   - Business analytics and market research
   - Back-office automation and efficiency
   - Client relationship management

## Examples of New B2B-Focused Questions
We validated the fix by generating sample questions. Here are examples of the properly B2B-focused questions:

### Strategy & Goals:
- "How is your real estate agency currently utilizing AI tools to enhance agent productivity and training?"
- "What are the primary goals for implementing AI-driven marketing strategies in your real estate brokerage over the next 12 months?"

### Data Readiness:
- "How does your property management firm ensure that data collected from IoT devices in properties is ready and optimized for predictive maintenance analytics?"
- "What strategies does your real estate agency employ to maintain data quality for AI-driven marketing campaigns?"

### Technology & Tools:
- "What AI-powered tools has your real estate agency implemented to support agent training and productivity enhancement?"
- "Which AI applications does your real estate agency utilize to improve marketing and lead generation efforts?"

### Team Skills & Process:
- "How has your real estate agency integrated AI tools to enhance agent productivity and training processes?"
- "To what extent have AI solutions improved the efficiency of back-office operations in your property management firm?"

### Governance & Measurement:
- "How does your real estate agency utilize AI to improve the accuracy and efficiency of property management operations?"
- "In what ways has AI been integrated into your brokerage's agent productivity tools, and how is its impact measured?"

## Implementation Details
- The fix was implemented in `app/api/scorecard-ai/route.ts`
- The change is isolated to the question generation process
- No other parts of the app required modification
- All future questions will be properly B2B-focused

## Status
- The fix is ready for review and testing
- Will not push to GitHub until you confirm
