# Property/Real Estate Industry B2B Question Fix - UPDATE

## Issue Summary
Two issues were identified in the Property/Real Estate industry questions:

1. **Original Issue (Fixed Previously)**: Questions were too consumer-focused, referencing "your real estate portfolio" which implied the user was a property owner/investor.

2. **New Issue (Fixed Now)**: All questions for the Property/Real Estate industry were being generated as text input fields only. There were no multiple-choice (radio/checkbox) or scale questions, creating a poor user experience.

## Solution Implemented
Modified the system prompt in `app/api/scorecard-ai/route.ts` to address both issues:

1. For the B2B focus issue, the prompt clearly instructs the AI to generate questions addressing business operations and AI use within real estate companies/agencies.

2. For the question type variety issue, we added explicit instructions for the AI to use a variety of question types:
   ```
   EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: You MUST use a VARIETY of question types. Do NOT default to only using "text" questions.
   For the current phase, select the most appropriate question type from:
   - "radio" for single-choice questions with 4-5 options (use for questions about frequency, level of adoption, primary approaches)
   - "checkbox" for multiple-choice questions with 4-6 options (use for questions about tools used, areas implemented, challenges faced)
   - "scale" for 1-5 rating questions (use for questions about effectiveness, satisfaction, maturity levels)
   - "text" for open-ended responses (use sparingly, only for complex questions requiring detailed explanation)
   ```

## Validation
Created an enhanced test script (`test-property-real-estate-questions.js`) that uses OpenAI's API to generate sample questions and validate question type distribution.

### Results
Generated 20 questions across all five assessment phases with the following distribution:
- Text: 5 questions (25%)
- Radio: 5 questions (25%)
- Checkbox: 5 questions (25%)
- Scale: 5 questions (25%)

This is an ideal balanced distribution of question types, similar to what users see in other industry selections.

### Sample Questions by Type

**Radio Question Example:**
"How frequently does your real estate agency utilize AI-driven tools for property management operations?"
Options: Always, Often, Sometimes, Rarely, Never

**Checkbox Question Example:**
"Which areas of your property management firm's operations have been improved by AI technologies? (Select all that apply)"
Options: Tenant management and communication, Maintenance scheduling and oversight, Lease management and compliance, Energy management and sustainability, Financial reporting and analysis

**Scale Question Example:**
"Rate the effectiveness of AI tools in enhancing agent productivity and training in your real estate brokerage."
Scale: 1 (Not effective) to 5 (Extremely effective)

**Text Question Example:**
"Describe the strategies your real estate agency has implemented to integrate AI into client relationship management."

## Implementation Details
- The fix was implemented in the `handleAssessmentRequest` function in `app/api/scorecard-ai/route.ts`
- Only the system prompt for the Property/Real Estate industry was modified
- All questions remain B2B-focused while now providing a variety of question types
- No other code or data structure changes were required

## Status
- The fix is ready for review and testing
- Will not push to GitHub until Ahmad confirms that the questions now contain a proper distribution of question types
