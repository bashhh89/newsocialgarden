## üéØ **CURRENT FOCUS: Address Critical Service Issues**

### **Priority 1: Email Service Configuration**
**Issue**: Resend API showing domain verification error for gmail.com
**Impact**: Lead notifications not being sent
**Action Required**: Configure proper sending domain

### **Priority 2: WeasyPrint Service**
**Issue**: Service at 168.231.115.219:5001 not responding properly
**Impact**: PDF generation may fail
**Action Required**: Test service connectivity and fallback options

### **Priority 3: Missing Template Files**
**Issue**: Build warnings for missing content-strategy-prompt.md and email-campaign.md
**Impact**: Learning hub template errors (non-critical)
**Action Required**: Create missing files or handle gracefully
