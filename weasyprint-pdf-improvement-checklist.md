## 1. Layout & Structure Issues

- [x] Inconsistent Alignment: Align headings, tables, and paragraphs for a visually even flow. *(DONE: standardized left alignment for text, added table alignment and padding)*
- [x] Abrupt Section Transitions: Insert clear dividers or visual transitions between sections. *(DONE: added .section-divider with gradient bar between sections)*

## 2. Typography & Font Problems

- [ ] Font Size Variability: Standardize font sizes for consistent readability.
- [ ] Single Font Usage: Introduce font variations (bold for emphasis, italics for nuance).
- [ ] Line Spacing Issues: Adjust line height for better vertical spacing and reduced compression.

## 3. Color & Branding

- [ ] Weak Contrast: Increase color contrast (especially text/background) for readability.
- [ ] Limited Branding: Embed strong branding (e.g., company colors, header/logo).

## 4. Graphical Enhancements

- [ ] No Callout Boxes: Add visually distinct boxes for critical recommendations/highlights.

## 5. Formatting & Readability

- [ ] Bullet Point Inconsistency: Apply uniform bullet styles across all lists.
- [ ] Indentation & Margins: Normalize indentation and outer margins throughout.
- [ ] Overlapping Sections: Remove redundant texts, especially in the executive summary.

## 6. Professional Polish

- [ ] Lack of Headers & Footers: Implement headers/footers with document info and branding.
- [ ] Text Justification: Standardize paragraph alignment (left or justified) for all sections.
- [ ] Spacing Between Sections: Ensure sufficient white space separates major components.
